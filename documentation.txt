When we write tests for the server using supertest, we can actually let supertest take care of the port binding 
which makes the tests much cleaner and easier to write. In order to do this, we wonâ€™t call app.listen in app.ts.
Instead we should remove the app.listen line and just export app from this file.

You want to allow each test file to start a server on their own. 

If you try to write many test files, you'll get an error that says "port in use". This is because you're trying to start the server on the same port in each test file. To fix this, you need to export app without listening to it. You can do this by removing the app.listen line and just exporting app from this file.
